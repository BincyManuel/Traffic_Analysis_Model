# Traffic_Analysis_Model
The model helps in the detection of cars along with their colours and the count of other vechiles. The model also helps in the detection of pedestrains count and the gender and age of the detcetd pedestrains. 

The count of cars and other vehicles are done using the count_model.ipynb.
Their colour is detected using the color_model.ipynb.
The pedestrain_model.ipynb file helps in the detection of pedestrains and the model.ipynb file helps in detecting the gende rof the pedestrains.
The datsets used for training the models is included in the text file datasets.txt
