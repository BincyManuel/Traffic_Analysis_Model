1
00:00:01,613 --> 00:00:04,826
This is a video that shows the working of the model,

2
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:09,773
which helps in the detection of the gender and age of the persons

3
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:14,000
in a meeting room. So, I will just run this code and show how

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,647
this works. So,

5
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:22,755
yeah, it's running over Let's

6
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:25,960
wait for a minute. Okay,

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,384
so here the window has been displayed.

8
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:32,369
And now when I click on this upload image option,

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,674
uh, it displays a screen for selecting the image.

10
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:40,219
So, I'm clicking just this test tree.

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,263
So, as you can see, according to the model,

12
00:00:43,283 --> 00:00:46,238
if the number of persons is less than two,

13
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:50,904
it should detect as, please upload an image with more than two people.

14
00:00:50,924 --> 00:00:54,489
So, when I click on this detect division gender button,

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,712
it shows upload an image with more than two people.

16
00:00:57,353 --> 00:00:59,933
So, I will upload an image.

17
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:03,388
More than two people, so I will upload this,

18
00:01:03,368 --> 00:01:08,175
so here, so when I click on the detect age and gender,

19
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:11,859
it shows that there are three males with the respective ages,

20
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:16,555
so I will also do this with another image,

21
00:01:16,695 --> 00:01:22,815
so here, so it's

22
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:27,355
showing a male of about 45 years old and a female of 25

23
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:30,135
years old, so thank you.
